            <h2>Adding Benches to Our Trip Planner</h2>
            <h4>Posted on June 23rd, 2016</h4>
            <p>While there aren’t fixed bus stops in Amman—you can get on or off a bus anywhere—the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has installed a variety of benches and bus shelters over the years, like this one:</p>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/blog-img/bench10.png">
            <p>Given how unpredictable buses can be, it’d be great if trip planner app steered users towards the nearest bench so they could sit as they wait for the bus. With this goal in mind, we reached out to the Amman municipality and got their GIS data set with the locations of all of the benches in Amman. The coverage isn't city-wide, but buses do line a few major corridors:</p>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/blog-img/gam-benches.png">
            <p>Getting the locations of the benches was a help to our app and it brings up an issue we face on a regular basis which is the role of open data in Amman. When it comes to sharing data, there certainly isn’t a consensus within the Greater Amman Municipality. There are certainly departments within GAM that embrace the idea that a city can get maximum value by sharing data rather than keeping it proprietary. Other departments in the municipality hold the view that data should generate revenue and that once the government gives it away for free they can’t get it back. </p>
            <p>The tension between these different views can result in some odd witholdings. The government gave us a data set of all the street names in Amman, but wouldn’t give us the houses numbers for the buildings on those streets. They gave us neighborhood names and boundaries, but wouldn’t share their data set of landmarks which would help in navigating those neighborhoods. And when we asked for elevation data, the response was a polite but firm: “No way”. Luckily, there are other sources of elevation data so our trip planner won’t send you hiking up big hills unnecessarily.</p>
            <p>In the context of GAM's traditional views towards data, it can be difficult to prove that open data is the wiser route. At the same time, it's a challenge that our group is in a position to take up. Our whole project to some degree is proof positive of the value that designers, academics, and the civic tech community can provide when they have better data on the city. The bus shelters are a small but effective example of this.</p>
            <p>Our process for integrating the locations of bus benches starts with how we currently represent bus lines behind the scenes. The international standard for organizing transit data is the General Transit Feed System (GTFS) which uses stop-locations as the backbone of how to encode transit information. Since there are no fixed stops in Amman, we’ve had to simulate fake “stops” every 200 meters to represent a bus’s route. Here are our simulated stops which you can see track the contours of the roads the buses travel:</p>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/blog-img/our-stops.png">
            <p>Using the data GAM gave us on bus shelters, I wrote script in Python to search the area around our simulated stops to see if there's a shelter nearby. If there is, I’ve moved our stop to coincide with the GAM bus shelter. Here's a close-up of our stops in green and the bus shelters in purple:</p>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/blog-img/misaligned-stops.png">
            <p>OpenTripPlanner, the wonderful open-source routing software that powers our app, currently directs people to those green dots to wait for a bus (in reality, you can wait anywhere along the road, but for the purposes of GTFS, we have to direct people towards a specific stop). By moving those green dots to align them with the benches, we can have our trip planner navigate people directly towards a bench where they can wait. Here's what that looks like after I moved the stops. The yellow circles are the stops that moved, which you can see now sit right on top of the bench locations:</p>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/blog-img/overlapping-stops.png">
            <p>There are a few real but managable wrinkles with this approach. First of all, GTFS uses stops in conjunction with fixed time schedules to tell people where to go and when to be there. That means that when we move the stops but don’t update the times, the schedule will be slightly off. In our case, our timing data is so imprecise anyways, that shifting stops by a few dozen meters doesn’t end up having much of an impact relative the larger variability around travel times and frequencies. The larger issue is that by programmatically moving stops in this way, I may have pulled a stop that was supposed to be on one road onto a neighborhing road where the bus doesn’t run (if it’s pulled along the same path as the bus, that’s fine). To hedge against this, I kept the radius for moving stops at a low threshold of 100 meters. I’ll then manually check the stops that have moved to see if any stops have been moved to the wrong locations.</p>
            <p>
                GTFS stops have a location_type column which is the GTFS way of designating “stations”. The manual defines a station as “a physical structure or area that contains one or more stops.”  Labeling roadside benches as “stations” may be a bit grand, but it does meet the GTFS definition of a physical structure. Plus, it’s either that or use the wheelchair_boarding column, which would certainly be off.
            </p>
            <p>I’m looking forward to seeing how our app developers at Not Another Fruit visually show that there’s a bench nearby where someone can sit. Longer term, I hope this bolsters our case for the value that the government can get in sharing data. Afterall, the government went through all the trouble of setting up benches around the city. By simply sharing that data, people will find it easier to use the benches. Even if it doesn’t have larger impacts in the open-data debate, if even a few people have a more pleasant transit experience by being able to rest as the bus comes, then it’s certainly been worth our time.</p>
